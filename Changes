0.8 Unreleased
    mboxcl2 handling is now a little more paranoid, and will recover from 
    bad values

    Mbox.pm now expects the From_ line to match either of
        /^From (?:Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)/
        /^From \S+\s+(?:Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)/
    (based on mutt mbox.c/from.c)

    Document that ->messages is a one-shot operation.

0.7 Tuesday 27th May, 2003
    Mbox.pm can grok mboxcl2

    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Email::Folder::Mbox now takes line endings as
    an explicit option rather than trying to guess.

0.6 Sunday 11th May, 2003
    Rename the files in the test maildir so we can unpack in Win32 systems
    Release with a auto-generated Makefile.PL, for CPAN.pm users

0.5 Tuesday 29th April, 2003
    Add iterator interface, plus move the backends to be classes

0.4 Thursday 24th April, 2003
    Add line-ending detection to Email::Folder::MBox
    temporarily disable signing, as it's confusing

0.3 Tuesday 22nd April, 2003
    Just another release of 0.2, now that CPAN repects my authoritay!

0.2 Tuesday 22nd April, 2003
    Lose the (hidden) dependency on UNIVERSAL::require

0.1 Initial version
    Very rough idea
